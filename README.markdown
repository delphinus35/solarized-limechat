Solarized Light for LimeChat
====================================

LimeChat is a decent IRC client for OS X. You can get it at http://limechat.net/mac/
Solarized is a color scheme that can be applied to just about any application. You can read more about it at http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized
Installing these color schemes is easy.

```
# Clone the github repo	
git clone https://github.com/paulcpederson/solarized-limechat.git /tmp/solarized-limechat

# Copy the files over to your Limechat Themes folder
mv /tmp/solarized-limechat/*  ~/Library/Application\ Support/LimeChat/Themes/

# Remove the Temporary folder
rm -rf /tmp/solarized-limechat
```

Then just choose "Solarized Responsive" inside limechat's preferences.

* Only the Light theme has been reformatted, dark theme and responsive styling soon to come. *
