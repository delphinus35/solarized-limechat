Solarized is a supremely well thought-out color scheme. Read more here: http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized
Installing these color schemes is easy.

```
# Clone the github repo	
git clone https://github.com/paulcpederson/solarized-limechat.git /tmp/solarized-limechat

# Copy the files over to your Limechat Themes folder
mv /tmp/solarized-limechat/*  ~/Library/Application\ Support/LimeChat/Themes/

# Remove the Temporary folder
rm -rf /tmp/solarized-limechat
```

Then just choose "Solarized Light" or "Solarized Dark" inside limechat's preferences.
